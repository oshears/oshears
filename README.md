# About Osaze Shears üòé

Hi! I am a research computer engineer at University of Southern California's (USC) Information Sciences Institute (ISI) in Arlington, VA. I am is passionate about many engineering and computational concepts including embedded systems, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and microprocessor technologies.


In my free time I work on game development projects with other artists and devs to develop multiplayer, VR, and 3D games. Updates are posted to my studio website: [OSGames](https://oshears.github.io/osgames/).

# FPGA-ASIC Projects üíª

My FPGA-ASIC design projects include the following:

- [BladeRF Delayed Feedback Reservoir (DFR) Accelerator](https://github.com/oshears/bladerf_dfr_accelerator): A project to implement a delayed feedback reservoir (DFR) on the bladeRF 2.0 micro software defined radio (SDR) FPGA.
- [Hybrid Delayed Feedback Reservoir (DFR) FPGA Bridge](https://github.com/oshears/hybrid_dfr_system): A project that leverages a heterogenous FPGA-ASIC architecture to implement a hardware accelerated and energy efficient delayed feedback reservoir (DFR).
- [FPGA Spiking Neural Network (SNN)](https://github.com/oshears/SNN-FPGA-Implementation/tree/master): A simple implementation of a spiking neural network with FPGA synthesizable RTL.
- [FPGA Friendly SNN Models](https://github.com/oshears/fpga_snn_models): Python implementations of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that have been designed for operation on FPGA.
- [Neuromorphic ASIC Bridge](https://github.com/oshears/neuromorphic_asic_bridge): The HDL FPGA Module to interface with the MICS Neuromorphic Reservoir Computing ASIC
 - [Neuromorphic ASIC Vision](https://github.com/oshears/neuromorphic_asic_vision): A set of scripts to feed video and images to the Neuromorphic ASIC
 - [Neuromorphic ASIC PetaLinux](https://github.com/oshears/neuromorphic_asic_bridge_petalinux): The PetaLinux source files for the Neuromorphic ASIC Bridge project

# Experienced Open-Source Projects üß†
